## Glue42 Windows

In order for windows created from an external WPF/WinForms applications to become Glue42 Windows, they must first be registered via the **.NET Window Management** API. 

## Window Options

You can set several window configuration options during window registration. To create an instance with window options, use:

```csharp
var glueWindowOptions = new GlueWindowOptions();
```

If the application is started by [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/), you can get any window startup options (regarding the application bounds, layout, etc.) by using:

```csharp
var glueWindowOptions = glue.GlueWindows.GetStartupOptions() ?? new GlueWindowOptions();
```

### Window Type

To set the type of the window:

```csharp
// Create a "flat" window.
glueWindowOptions.WithType(GlueWindowType.Flat);

// Create a "tab" window.
glueWindowOptions.WithType(GlueWindowType.Tab);
```

### Window Title

To set the title of the window:

```csharp
glueWindowOptions.WithTitle("My Window");
```

## Registering Windows 

To register a window as a Glue42 Window, use the `RegisterWindow()` method passing the window object as a first parameter and a window options object as a second:

```csharp
await glue.GlueWindows.RegisterWindow(this, glueWindowOptions);
```

The `RegisterWindow()` method returns a window instance of type `IGlueWindow`.

### WPF Windows

*Note that it is **mandatory** for an external WPF application to have an `app.manifest` file with the following section:*

```xml
<application xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v3">
    <windowsSettings>
        <dpiAware xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/SMI/2005/WindowsSettings">true/PM</dpiAware>
    </windowsSettings>
</application>
```
You can register a WPF window right after its creation. You can do this either in the window code or from an external component. To register a WPF window, use:

```csharp
// Register the window by using `this` window as a first parameter.
await glue.GlueWindows.RegisterWindow(this, glueWindowOptions);
```

Full example:

```csharp
// using Tick42;
// using Tick42.Windows;

// Get and set window options.
var glueWindowOptions = glue.GlueWindows.GetStartupOptions() ?? new GlueWindowOptions();

glueWindowOptions.WithType(GlueWindowType.Tab);

glueWindowOptions.WithTitle("My Window");

// Register the window.
await glue.GlueWindows.RegisterWindow(this, glueWindowOptions);
```

WPF windows are automatically unregistered when they are closed. If you want to manually unregister a window at a different point in time, use:

```csharp
glueWindow.Unregister();
```

*See the .NET [WPF window registration example](https://github.com/Tick42/net-examples/tree/master/wpf-sw) on GitHub.*

### WinForms Windows

You can register a WinForms window by using its handle:

```csharp
// Get and set window options.
var glueWindowOptions = glue.GlueWindows.GetStartupOptions() ?? new GlueWindowOptions();

glueWindowOptions.WithType(GlueWindowType.Flat);

glueWindowOptions.WithTitle("My Window");

// Register the window by using its handle as a first parameter.
IGlueWindow glueWindow = await glue.GlueWindows.RegisterWindow(this.Handle, glueWindowOptions);
```

WinForms windows do not support automatic unregistration. You should explicitly call `Unregister()` when the window is closed:

```csharp
glueWindow.Unregister();
```

## Registering Windows as App Instances

The .NET Window Management library allows WPF and WinForms applications to announce the windows initiated by them as Glue42 application instances (see [Application Management](../../../application-management/net/index.html)). This is necessary when you have a [multi window application](../../../application-management/net/index.html#multi_window_apps) and its windows are registered as Glue42 applications - then the multi window application becomes responsible for notifying [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/) about new app instances.

The `RegisterAppWindow()` method registers the window both as a Glue42 Window and as a Glue42 application instance. It accepts the WPF window object (or the WinForms window handle), the Glue42 application object, the application name and an application options builder as arguments:

```csharp
var placement = new GlueWindowScreenPlacement();

glue.GlueWindows.RegisterAppWindow(myWindow, myWindow, myWindowAppName,
        // Specify application options.
        builder => builder
        .WithPlacement(placement)
        .WithType(GlueWindowType.Tab));
```

*For more details on multi window application support, see [Multi Window Apps](../../../application-management/net/index.html#multi_window_apps) and the .NET [Multi Window Demo example](https://github.com/Tick42/net-examples/tree/master/multiwindow-demo) on GitHub.*

## Window Operations

Once an application window is registered, the Window Management API will accept full control over the window positioning, sizing and visibility. The application should not use *native* methods (for example, WPF/WinForms calls) to control the window as it will interfere with the Glue42 window management. 

You can perform operations on the current window and on any other registered window.

The window object also offers access to the host application instance, connecting the Window Management API with the [Application Management API](../../../application-management/net/index.html):

```csharp
IAppManagerApplication appInstance = targetWindow.Instance;
```

## Current Window

To get a reference to the current window, use:

```csharp
var myWindow = await glue.GlueWindows.RegisterWindow(this, glueWindowOptions);
```

### Title

To set the window title, use:

```csharp
myWindow.Title = "New title";
```

### Size and Position

To change the bounds of the window, use:

```csharp
// Set the window bounds - left, top, width, height.
var newWindowBounds = new GlueWindowBounds(10, 10, 200, 200);

myWindow.Bounds = newWindowBounds; 
```

### Visibility

To hide the window, use:

```csharp
myWindow.IsVisible = false;
```

## Handling Other Windows

The .NET Window Management API allows you to find all Glue42 Windows and manipulate them. To find all Glue42 Windows, use the `GetGDWindows()` method of the .NET Window Management API:

```csharp
await glue.GlueWindows.GetGDWindows();
```

The `GetGDWindows()` method returns a window instance of type `IGDWindow`.

### Finding Windows

To get a collection of all Glue42 Windows, use:

```csharp
var allWindows = await glue.GlueWindows.GetGDWindows();
```

To await your newly registered window to be published to the window collection, use:

```csharp
var myWindow = await glue.GlueWindows.RegisterWindow(this, glueWindowOptions);

await glue.GlueWindows.AwaitWindow(window => window.Id == myWindow.Id);

// The collection will now contain `myWindow`.
var allWindows = await glue.GlueWindows.GetGDWindows();
```

To find a window by ID, use:

```csharp
var targetWindowId = "29476_0";
var allWindows = await glue.GlueWindows.GetGDWindows();
var targetWindow = allWindows.FirstOrDefault(window => window.Descriptor.Id == targetWindowId);
```

To find a window by name, use:

```csharp
var targetWindowName = "target-window";
var allWindows = await glue.GlueWindows.GetGDWindows();
var targetWindow = windows.FirstOrDefault(window => window.Descriptor.Name == targetWindowName);
```

To find the main window of an application instance by application instance ID, use:

```csharp
var instanceId = "29476_1";
IGDWindow mainWindow = await glue.GlueWindows.AwaitWindow(window => window.Id == instanceId);
```

To find all windows of any application, use:

```csharp
var applicationName = "client-list";
IEnumerable<IGDWindow> appWindows = (await glue.GlueWindows.GetGdWindows())
    .Where(window => window.Descriptor.Name == applicationName);
```

To find all windows of the current application, use:

```csharp
var appWindows = glue.GlueWindows.OwnWindows;
```

### Updating Windows

To manipulate any Glue42 Window, use the `Update()` method of the window instance.

#### Window Title

```csharp
var allWindows = await glue.GlueWindows.GetGDWindows();
var newTitle = "New Title";
var targetWindow = allWindows.FirstOrDefault((window) => 
{
    return window.Descriptor.Name == "My Window";
});

await targetWindow.Update((window) =>
{
	window.SetTitle((titleOptions) => titleOptions.Title = newTitle);
});
```

#### Hiding a Window

```csharp
await targetWindow.Update((window) =>
{
	window.Hide();
});
```

#### Showing a Window

```csharp
await targetWindow.Update((window) =>
{
	window.Show();
});
```

#### Closing a Window

```csharp
await targetWindow.Update((window) =>
{
	window.Close();
});
```

## Window Events

The .NET Window Management API offers methods for listening for Glue42 Window events. To get notified for window events, use the `Subscribe()` method directly on an API level or on a window instance. 

The example below demonstrates subscribing for an event by using `Subscribe()` on an API level:

```csharp
var subscription = glue.GlueWindows.Subscribe(
    // Reference to the window for which to receive event notifications.
    targetWindow,
    // The lambda specifies for which window property to receive event notifications.
    p => p.Title,
    // Event handler.
    (descriptor, eventType, propertyChangedName, newPropertyValue, oldValue) =>
        {
            var title = descriptor.Title;
        }
);
```

To stop listening for any window event, use the `Dispose()` method of the subscription object returned by `Subscribe()`:

```csharp
subscription.Dispose();
```

Some of the available window events are described below. The examples demonstrate how to subscribe for them through the window instance.

### Title

To get notified when the window title changes:

```csharp
var subscription = window.Subscribe(
    EventType.TitleChanged, 
    (descriptor, eventType) =>
        {
            var title = descriptor.Title;
        }
);
```

### Bounds

To get notified when the window bounds change:

```csharp
var subscription = window.Subscribe(
    EventType.BoundsChanged, 
    (descriptor, eventType) =>
        {
            var bounds = descriptor.Bounds;
        }
);
```

### Visibility

To get notified when the window visibility changes:

```csharp
var subscription = window.Subscribe(
    EventType.VisibilityChanged, 
    (descriptor, eventType) =>
        {
            var isVisible = descriptor.isVisible;
        }
);
```

### Frame Color

To get notified when the window frame color changes:

```csharp
var subscription = window.Subscribe(
    EventType.FrameColorChanged, 
    (descriptor, eventType) =>
        {
            var frameColor = descriptor.FrameColor;
        }
);
```

## WPF Example

This is a minimalistic WPF example that registers its main window as a Glue42 window. You can clone the repo with our Glue42 .NET examples on [GitHub](https://github.com/Tick42/net-examples) (`wpf-sw` subfolder example).

`App.xaml` - initialize Glue42:

```csharp
public partial class App : Application
{
    public static Glue42 Glue;

    protected override void OnStartup(StartupEventArgs e)
    {
        base.OnStartup(e);    

        Glue = new Glue42();
        Glue.Initialize("MyDemo");        
    }
```

`MainWindow.xaml.cs` - register the window:

```csharp
public partial class MainWindow : Window
{
    public MainWindow()
    {
        InitializeComponent();

        var glueWindowOptions = App.Glue.GlueWindows.GetStartupOptions() ?? new GlueWindowOptions();
        glueWindowOptions.WithType(GlueWindowType.Flat);
        glueWindowOptions.WithTitle("Example Window");

        // Register the window. 
        App.Glue.GlueWindows.RegisterWindow(this, glueWindowOptions)
            .ContinueWith(r =>
            {
                IGlueWindow glueWindow = r.Result;
            });
    }
}

```
