[**Glue42 Core**](https://glue42.com/core/) is mainly targeted for use with Progressive Web Applications. Combining PWAs with [**Glue42 Core**](https://glue42.com/core/) not only leverages the advantages of PWAs (native-like feel, working offline, enhanced performance, etc.), but incorporates an interoperability layer in your web application ecosystem as well.
