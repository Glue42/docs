## Welcome to Glue42 Enterprise!

[**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/) is a desktop integration platform which brings order and efficiency to the business desktop. It helps you declutter your workspace and make the most use of the precious desktop real estate when your daily workflow requires you to use multiple applications. [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/) allows developers to integrate applications not only at a UI level - providing you with the look and feel of a single app, but also at a functional level - enabling applications to interoperate by communicating with each other. You no longer need to copy-paste your way through several applications multiple times a day just to get the necessary information - [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/) reduces this tiresome and time consuming process to just a single click! What's more, this works for legacy and modern desktop or web apps, and for apps using different technologies - JavaScript, Java, .NET, VBA, Delphi, Node.js, Angular, React, etc.

*In the following sections you will get to know [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/) by using the trial demo edition. If you have not already done so, download the trial installer from the [official Glue42 site](https://glue42.com) and see the [How to Install](../install-system-requirements/index.html) section. Keep in mind that all functionalities and UIs of [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/) can be fully redesigned and customized to suit your specific needs and requirements.*

## Glue42 Toolbar

The [Glue42 Toolbar](../../../glue42-concepts/glue42-toolbar/index.html) is a customizable application which acts as an application hub and offers useful shortcuts and functionalities. Start your Glue42 enabled apps from here, mark your favorite apps, save and restore Workspaces and Layouts, define a default Global Layout that will be auto loaded on startup, search, see notifications, customize settings, restart or shutdown [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/). There are two options for a Toolbar - a Floating Toolbar and a Launchpad.

### Floating Toolbar

The Floating Toolbar is the default Toolbar for the demo. It is always on screen, you can move it anywhere by dragging or minimize it.

![Floating Toolbar](../../../images/toolbar/floating-toolbar.gif)

### Launchpad

The Launchpad is a Windows style Toolbar that is hidden on startup and is activated by pressing a configurable shortcut. Showing the Toolbar only on demand saves screen space and makes locating it much easier. The Launchpad is best suited for power users who prefer working with keyboard shortcuts.

## Window Management 

[**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/) offers you an extremely flexible way of arranging all your Glue42 enabled apps on your desktop:

- Stick or unstick windows to make them move, resize or close together.
- Organize your applications in tab groups.
- Drag tab windows or tab groups directly into other tab windows or tab groups.
- Tear out tabs as independent windows.
- Move and resize windows or window groups.
- Maximize, minimize and collapse windows or window groups.

## Workspaces

[Workspaces](../../../glue42-concepts/windows/workspaces/overview/index.html) allow you to arrange multiple applications within the same visual window (Frame). This is performed either programmatically or by dragging and dropping floating windows in a Workspace, rearranging windows that are already in the Workspace or extracting windows from the Workspace. Each application is treated as an individual building block that can be added, removed, moved or resized within the unifying Frame. Save easily Workspace layouts and restore them within the same Frame or even in different Frames. The Frame can hold multiple Workspaces (as tabs) and can also be maximized, minimized or resized. When a Workspace layout is restored, the arrangement of the apps participating in it and their context data is preserved - resume working right from where you left off.

## Application Data Synchronization

Besides UI integration, [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/) brings application integration on a functional level. By being able to communicate with each other, your apps will not only look as one unified macro application, but will start working together as components of a single system as well. [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/) offers the developers several different approaches to [sharing data between apps](../../../glue42-concepts/data-sharing-between-apps/shared-contexts/overview/index.html), which guarantees flexibility in finding and implementing swift and reliable development solutions for your apps. 

In the example below, apps communicate and synchronize cross-application data between each other by using the Glue42 [Channels](../../../glue42-concepts/data-sharing-between-apps/channels/overview/index.html):

![Channels](../../../images/channels/channels.gif)

Below is an example of a Glue42 [Activity](../../../glue42-concepts/data-sharing-between-apps/activities/overview/index.html) - a predefined collection of applications, organized in a layout, sharing a private context to communicate with each other:

![Activity](../../../images/activities/activity.gif)

## Global Layouts

When you set up the apps on your desktop the way you like them, or arrange a set of apps and/or workspaces needed for a specific task, save this Layout and later restore it when you need to use it again. All your apps will be restored with the same position, size and state on the desktop. What's more, mark a saved Layout as a default Global Layout and it will be restored upon startup of [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/):

![Global Layout](../../../images/layouts/layouts.gif)

## Glue42 Connectors

[**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/) provides [Connectors](../../../connectors/general-overview/index.html) for 3rd party applications like MS Office, Bloomberg, Salesforce, Fidessa, etc. The Glue42 Connectors allow you to continue using all applications with which you are already familiar and comfortable.

See how convenient and easy it is to open a client's portfolio in an Excel sheet at the click of a button:

![Connectors](../../../images/use-glue/connectors-office.gif)

The Glue42 Bloomberg Connector enables the interaction between the Bloomberg Components and the Glue42 enabled apps. One of the features of the BBG Connector is the synchronization between the Bloomberg Groups and the Glue42 Channels. See below how a financial instrument is updated in a BBG Component (or in a Glue42 enabled app on the corresponding Channel) and the change is reflected in all other apps and components:

![Connectors](../../../images/bloomberg/bbg-channels.gif)

## Notifications

The [Glue42 Notifications Service](../../../glue42-concepts/notifications/overview/index.html) receives notifications from all defined notification sources and delivers them directly to your desktop via a notifications UI. The notifications can contain buttons with prioritized actions, which allows you to respond quickly and accordingly by opening the necessary applications with a single click.

Use the demo GNS Action Tester to explore the notifications UI:

## Global Search

The Global Search app enables you to search through multiple search providers (applications, backend services, etc.), providing you almost instantly with the necessary information. This saves you the time and trouble of performing multiple searches in different apps until you finally find what you need. The Global Search is activated by pressing a configurable shortcut. [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/) by default is a search provider for applications, Layouts and actions (switching the theme, saving and restoring Layouts, opening URLs directly in Glue42 Windows, restarting or shutting down Glue42). 

![Search](../../../images/search/global-search-usage.gif)

## Themes

Change the theme of [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/) from the "Settings" button in the Glue42 Toolbar dropdown menu. [Themes](../../../glue42-concepts/windows/themes/overview/index.html) can be customized and new themes can be added. Instrument your apps to track the current theme, which will integrate them visually and further enhance the perception that all your different apps are part of a single enterprise program.
